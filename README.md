# DistillNet: Efficient Image Classification via Knowledge Distillation

DistillNet is a comprehensive MLOps pipeline for knowledge distillation in image classification. The project demonstrates how to train a smaller, efficient "student" model that learns from a larger "teacher" model while maintaining comparable performance.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a complete MLOps pipeline for knowledge distillation with the following components:

- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 image classification dataset
- **Teacher Model**: ResNet50 (high performance, but computationally expensive)
- **Student Model**: ResNet18 (smaller, more efficient, suitable for deployment)
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfer knowledge from teacher to student using KL divergence loss
- **MLOps Tools**: MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning
- **Deployment**: 
  - Streamlit interactive application for image classification with direct model loading
  - Deployable via Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch and torchvision
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, but recommended for training)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prashanth-31/DistillNet_Efficient_Image_Classification_via_Knowledge_Distillation.git
cd distillnet
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training Pipeline

1. Train the teacher model:
```bash
python src/train_teacher.py
```

2. Train the student model with knowledge distillation:
```bash
python src/train_student.py
```

3. Evaluate and compare models:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

### Model Deployment

#### Local Deployment

1. Start the Streamlit app (direct model loading, no API required):
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to use the Streamlit interface.

#### Docker Deployment

For detailed instructions on Docker deployment, see [DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

#### AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment

For detailed instructions on AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment, see [AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md](AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## 📊 MLflow Tracking

This project uses MLflow to track experiments. To view the MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri ./mlruns
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## 🧪 Knowledge Distillation

The knowledge distillation process involves:

1. Training a large teacher model (ResNet50) on CIFAR-10
2. Using the teacher's soft predictions to guide the training of a smaller student model (ResNet18)
3. Combining standard cross-entropy loss with KL divergence loss to transfer knowledge

The distillation loss is defined as:

```
L = α * KL(softmax(student_logits/T), softmax(teacher_logits/T)) + β * CrossEntropy(student_logits, labels)
```

where:
- T is the temperature parameter (higher values produce softer probability distributions)
- α and β are weights for the distillation and standard loss components

## 📈 Performance Comparison

| Metric | Teacher (ResNet50) | Student (ResNet18) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Parameters | ~23.5M | ~11.2M |
| Accuracy | ~93-95% | ~92-93% |
| Inference Time | ~10-20ms | ~5-10ms |
| Model Size | ~90MB | ~44MB |

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Setting up GitHub Secrets

To enable the CI/CD pipeline, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add the following repository secrets:

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS access key with permissions for ECR and Elastic Beanstalk |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS secret access key |
| `AWS_REGION` | The AWS region where you want to deploy (e.g., `us-east-1`) |

### Required AWS Permissions

The AWS user associated with the access keys needs the following permissions:
- AmazonECR-FullAccess
- AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess

### Workflow Details

The GitHub Actions workflow performs the following steps:
1. Builds the Docker image using `Dockerfile.streamlit`
2. Pushes the image to Amazon ECR
3. Creates a deployment package for Elastic Beanstalk
4. Deploys the application to Elastic Beanstalk

### Monitoring Deployments

You can monitor the deployment status in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.
